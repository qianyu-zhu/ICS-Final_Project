# ICS_Final_Project_GUI
This is the final project for Introduction to Computer Science in NYUShanghai, 2020 Fall

Our project is a Chatting system equipped with mailbox-authentication, account management, dynamic chatting services, and game function (multi-player Gobang, Snake, and shooting game with self-designed logo). The whole system is presented through GUI.

Since the presentation contains several video cuts, the coding and presentation are stored in google drive.
